# MENlogin

- A simple template I made for Facebook and Google Logins. 

- Use this template to get started with the MEN of a MEAN stack application build. 

- First clone and run NPM INSTALL

- To run from terminal use NPM START then visit localhost:3000

- You can add Angular or React for front-end dev if preferred

- You will need to include your own .env file with credentials for facebook & google auth
